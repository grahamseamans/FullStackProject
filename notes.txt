Make Github Repo - Done YAY :D


Decide on interfaces (what objects are we passing back and forth?)
* To backend
   * Add city (from searchbar?)
* From backend
   * List of city objects
      * Name
      * Tickets
         * Ticket price - string or number
         * Link to ticket price - href
      * Weather
         * Temp … numbers
         * Wind ... number
      * Events
         * Event info


Make backend
* Daniel?


        Graham Notes:
* maybe 2 options?
   * We make a seperate backend
      * Im trying to wrap my head around how this would work, but it seems like we would be effectively hosting two things - 
         * One front end service using the ‘create-react-app’ infrastructure
         * A second backend ~restful api
         * Both would need to be hosted separately I think, and would talk to each other through http calls
      * This would allow us to store a list of cities that the user went to without using cookies
      * Could use AWS to create an instance of EC2 server 
         * Ssh into it
         * Create a public ip
      * Use heroku like in other class projects


   * Make the “backend” in create-react-app (would probably be super easy) 
      * Could use express https://dev.to/loujaybee/using-create-react-app-with-express
      * So we could do our whole backend using this in react if we wanted to do it that way https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch 


* Create getters once we know what the front end will want.
* Store cookies to know what cities the user has added before
* If no cookie add users current location and start from there
* When user adds a new city should it go above or below their current location (where in the list should it be appended to)?


Make frontend
* Use react all the way? (can we?)
   * Make a card class thing - add a border around the whole thing
      * Characteristics
         * Flexbox so horizontal when screen is wide
            * Wide
               * City , graphics, price
            * Skinny
               * City
               * Graphics
               * price
      * Fields
         * City (href to city page)
         * Graphics - React3fiber - react component
         * Ticket price (href to skyscanner)
   * The search bar
      * Text field - only thing with border?
      * Sends a call back to the back end to add a city to the city list
      * How does it it show the user if the call to the back end gets an error?
   * New div - now the cards (everything else (the only other thing))
      * Stick the cards into a flexbox so they populate the screen and work with different screen widths - fill them in rows...
      * Iterate over list of cities with their data
      * Fill out the cards data with the lists data
   * https://reactrouter.com/ will allow us to route between webpages
   * What this type of webpage is called that we're making https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application#:~:text=A%20single%2Dpage%20application%20(SPA,browser%20loading%20entire%20new%20pages. 


* Get talking with API’s - make the meta-objects
   * Anything that we want to use and reuse should be a react component
      * So each tile / card would be a react component
      * Takes in arguments - props 
         * Props are immutable
         * Children should not change the props they receive
      * Components can have state
         * That’s just called state
      * Anytime props or state change it should rerender
         * So you can redeclare things all the time and it wont rerender them, so you declare stuff all the time


* How do we make the cards like we have above? - how to throw the card into a div flexbox
   * For each loop through the json of cities_data (taken from calling getCitiesData()
      * Takes each city (foreach…)
         * makes a card for it
         * Adds the card to the cities div (on mainpage)
* How do we make a card? - what’s the dumbest way to make a card using react hooks?
   * Sounds like a react template? Do these exist? 
   * It could also be a function that takes in the city parameters and spits out the html for a city
* Where do we call the back end? - Where do we ask for the information in all of this?
   * Get cities data - list of cities (not all the city info) - for main_page
   * Get city data - one city (all of the city info) - for city_page


* Create responsive web design (mobile, tablet views)
* Home page
   * Create search bar
   * Create divs that displays city objects (see above)
      * Fun graphics (?)
* Page for individual cities
   * Could we use the same card for both of these things and just have the events field be empty on the one in the main page?
   * Use the same card creation function (template?) from main_page, but just not supply an events field in the main page… - maybe we can get away with using the same code for the city_page as in the main_page / cities_page


* How react seems to work?
   * Little html frame
   * Stick things into the html frame using react (js)

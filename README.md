Deployed here: https://city-info-web.herokuapp.com/

## How To Install Dependencies

- In root - `npm install`
- In jet-set-front-end - `npm install`

## How To Run

- In root - `npm start`
- In jet-set-front-end - `npm start`
  The front end uses a proxy for the dev environment and the backend handles any cors issues.

## How To Use

- Search for a city in the searchbar.
- Maybe search for another city?
- Click the city name to see more details about the city.
- Maybe follow a ticket master link or head back to the main page with the arrow at the top left.

## How To Build

- Although it's not necissary as the method descibed in 'How To Run' above works, you can build in jet-set-front-end with `npm run build`
- The backend will now host the front end at http://localhost:4000 if you run `npm start` in the root directory.

## Deployment

- The dev branch is what is currently autodeployed on Heroku (link to live page at the top).
